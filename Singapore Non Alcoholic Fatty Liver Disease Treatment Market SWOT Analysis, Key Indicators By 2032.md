Fatty liver disease refers to the accumulation of fat (triglycerides,) in the liver. The liver cell contains fats, but the accumulation of excess fat can be a cause of concern and can lead to liver inflammation known as steatohepatitis.  The fatty liver can be caused by alcohol as well as can be non-alcohol.  Steatohepatitis can cause liver cirrhosis (fibrosis, scarring, and hardening of the liver). The cause of non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) is unknown. The nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) is one of the most common diseases in the United States. The prevalence of nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) is rising due to rise in prevalence of diabetes and obesity. According to National Health and Nutrition Examination survey, about 20-30% of the general population in the western world suffer from nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD). The common symptoms include fatigue, weakness, weight loss and others. The diagnosis of NAFLD requires the combination of different tests such as blood test, ultrasound, CT scan, MRI scan, and liver biopsy.  The two types of Nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) includes simple fatty liver and Nonalcoholic Steatohepatitis (NASH). The simple fatty liver is a type of nonalcoholic fatty liver (NAFL), in which fat is deposited, but no inflammation or liver damage is observed. NASH is the inflammation of the liver due to excess fat deposit and can lead to liver damage and disease.
